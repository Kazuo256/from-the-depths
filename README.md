# From the Depths

From The Depths is a minimalistic real-time strategy game. A series of
relentless earthquakes proved a throwback to civilization, and from the fissures
across the globe enormous monsters emerged. Though not particularly menacing,
their bottomless hunger threatens the scarce supplies humanity fights every day
for in this devasted world. You must manage the workers who brave the wastelandsto make sure humanity does not starve.
